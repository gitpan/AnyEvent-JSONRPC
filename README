This is a fork of Daisuke Murase's Perl module AnyEvent::JSONRPC::Lite.

CHANGES

This module is updated to use Yuval Kogman's JSON::RPC::Common for handling
the JSONRPC messages. This enables support for handling messages complying to
all versions of the JSONRPC standard.

The System Services/Service Description parts of version 1.1-wd and 1.1-alt is
unimplemented and left to users to implement.

TODO

There are the following outstanding issues before a real release

  - Testing of new features (support for multiple versions)
  - Making sure that marshalling of parameters makes sense in both ends
